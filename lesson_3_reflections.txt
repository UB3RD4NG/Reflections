When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When there are static and stable versions of a project.
The released versions can be published in a remote repository while the entire project can be local.
If the project is open source or others need to access it.
When multiple folks are working on the same project and asynchronously updating files in it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Local changes can be overridden by changes on the remote repository if someone else made the update.
In progress local work might be tied off, lost, or have merge conflicts if a remote update touches the same files
Branch nomenclature might get mixed up if the local and remote repos are named differently
